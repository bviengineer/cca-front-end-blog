                    <h2>Practical Steps For Success In A Coding Bootcamp</h2>
                        <p>So you've jumped on the bandwagon and decided to sign up for a bootcamp, or formally, a cohort, and is excited about all the languages and fameworks you are expecting learn but have never written a line of code, or, have very little experience coding.  Here are some pratical steps that can help you keep up in such a moderate to fast-paced learning environment:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Look over the list of languages and framworks you are expecting to learn</li>
                                <li>Familiarize yourself with the languages</li>
                                <li>Attend class &amp; Particpate</li>
                                <li>Practice, Practice, Practice</li>
                                <li>Network</li>
                            </ol>
                    <img src="img/code.jpg" alt="Image of Computer code">
                    <h3>Languages</h3>
                    <p>Asking the cohort or the instructor of your cohort ahead of time the languages you will be learning gives you an idea of what you will be learning and also allows you to do your homework on the job market for the specfic skillset you will obtain and the number of jobs available.</p>

                    <h3>Familiarize yourself</h3>
                    <p>
                        Use complimentary resources on the internet or availbale at your local library and start building the foundation for the languages or frameworks, their syntax, when and how to use them.  For example, one of the first languages coding bootcamps teach you is HTML. If you have never heard of HTML, take time out to learn what the acroynm means and how to use it.  Durinig self-discovery, you may not understand everything and as a result, it's best to keep a list of questions you will have for your instructor once the cohort begins. In doing the legwork, you can maximize your time in the cohort by obtaining clarification on confusing topics and syntax versus spending time trying to learn the information being taught while also applying it.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Attend Class &amp; Participate</h3>
                    <p>All through college I was consistently told, 80% of success is showing up!. When you sign up, show up.  Some cohorts offer remote options for attending class. If you find you may not physically make it to class one day, promptly inform your instructor and ask for the remote access.  Participting in class disucssions and answering questions helps the instructor in understanding how well you are learning the information.</p>

                    <h3>Pratice</h3>
                    <p></p>

                    <h3>Network</h3>
                    <p>Yes, network! Join relative meetup groups, attend as many as you can, introduce yourself. In doing so, you'll find others also on a similar journey, those who have finished the journey and those who may know of companies that are hiring.</p>

                    <h3>Closing</h3>
                    <p>In closing, you determine the level of success you can have out of your cohort.</p>
